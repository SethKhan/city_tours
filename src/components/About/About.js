                    <p>Haunted houses have been around since ghosts became a possibility in our minds. 
                        It may have started as a haunted cave or castle, but we have haunted houses in 
                        modern times.Whether you believe in ghosts or not, 
                        scary old haunted houses likely send a chill down your spine.All throughout the country there are scary houses of all different styles and time periods, which have been home to people from all walks of life, from the most ordinary farmers to the wealthiest businessmen and high society families.  
                         They may all share quite a few differences, but they all share one common trait: they’re haunted</p>
                        <p>America has a particularly interesting history with haunted houses; owing to the vastness of American geography 
                        these hauntings can date back to the founding of the country or be far more recent. Ever get worried when something goes bump in the night or you don’t 
                        have a logical explanation as to why something seems to be in a different place? The truth is these houses and scary things 
                        in general are beyond our control. The mind goes to different places and all of a sudden the emotional center of the mind 
                        overtakes the rational center and that’s why people jump and get started much more easily, thus reinforcing how scary these houses are</p>
